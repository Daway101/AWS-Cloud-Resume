        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Dawa Tsering, a passionate tech enthusiast with a background in economics and mathematics. I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner with foundational knowledge of cloud computing, infrastructure management, security best practices and industry regulations.</p>
        <p>With my experience as a former math teacher, founder of a tutoring business and a customer support team, I bring a unique blend of analytical and problem-solving skills to the table. My Himalayan heritage has shaped my perspective, emphasizing adaptability and resilience, which I now channel into mastering cloud computing.Â I craft code and scripts in programming languages like JavaScript and Python, while also fluently reading, writing and speaking human languages such as Nepali, Hindi and Urdu.</p>
        <p>I have hands-on experience with core AWS services like EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for database management and the AWS Well-Architected Framework for designing scalable and secure cloud environments. Iâ€™ve gained practical insights into monitoring and troubleshooting using CloudWatch, delivering cost-effective solutions using AWS Cost Explorer and billing optimization strategies and applying IAM best practices for secure access management.</p>
        <p>My cross-functional expertise enable me to contribute effectively to cloud innovation and cost-effective infrastructure deployment. I believe that just like in software engineering, where CI/CD ensures rapid and reliable updates, applying Continuous Improvement and Continuous Development in life helps you evolve, stay relevant, and achieve your personal and professional goals. ðŸš€
